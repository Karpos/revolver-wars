 * removed dependency from LuaExpat. Lqt now uses Roberto Ierusalimschy XML parser. Thanks to it I can bulid indices of the entries while parsing, reducing generation time to few seconds from several minutes.
 * included an old lqtscript code, for historical reasons.
 * the generated code can now be built with cmake.
 * X11 specific code should have gone.
 * fixed a big number of bugs in the generator code. Most of the generated code compiles cleanly now and in some cases where it does not it is gccxml fault, not mine.
 * added the future replacement for gccxml
