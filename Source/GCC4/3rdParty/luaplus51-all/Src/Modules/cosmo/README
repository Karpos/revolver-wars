Cosmo is a "safe templates" engine.  It allows you to fill nested
templates, providing many of the advantages of Turing-complete
template engines, without without the downside of allowing arbitrary
code in the templates.

The current version of Cosmo is 10.03.31. This version adds
expressions to selectors $(<exp>), allows nested [[ ]] in templates,
makes commas between subtemplates optional, and adds a second parameter
to cosmo.yield that tells Cosmo the first parameter is a literal to be
included in the expansion instead of an environment.
 
Cosmo is installed as a rock. To install the most recent release
do `luarocks install cosmo`. The Cosmo rock is in the standard
repository. Installation on UNIX-based systems need the gcc toolchain.
