// ====================================
// Script Events: Overview
// 
// This system provides the glue that allows events to be sent to or received by the script.  There is some C++ setup
// involved but once done, event passing between the boundary becomes completely transparent.
// 
// ====================================
// Setup (C++):
// 
// In order to make an event able to be seen & processed by the script, you must follow four steps:
//		1) Inherit your event class from ScriptEvent
//		2) Implement VBuildEventData() and VBuildEventFromScript() if necessary (see the comments above their prototypes 
//		   for details)
//		3) Call the EXPORT_FOR_SCRIPT_EVENT() macro in your event subclass declaration
//		4) Call the REGISTER_SCRIPT_EVENT() macro in Application::RegisterScriptEvents() or the game-specific subclass
//		   override, as appropriate
// 
// Once done, your event should be visible to the script.  In script, the EventType table will contain a member indexed 
// by the event type string containing the event id.  This id matches the EventType for the appropriate event.
//
// ====================================
// Sending Events from Script:
// 
// To send an event from script, you will need to create a table that contains the necessary data, then call the
// exported QueueEvent() or SendEvent() function.  The first parameter is the event type (from the EventType table)
// and the second parameter is the table.
// 
// In C++, this table is assigned to the m_eventData variable and used by your VBuildEventFromScript() implementation 
// to fill out your C++ members.  If something goes wrong, return false and the event won't be sent.  If you don't 
// need to receive the event on the C++ side, it doesn't matter and you can keep the default implementation of 
// VBuildEventFromScript().
// 
// Events are received on the C++ side as normal.  Inherit from EventListener and register for the appropriate event
// type.  Your receiver doesn't know nor does it care where the event came from.
// 
// ====================================
// Receiving Events in Script:
// 
// To register an event listener in script, call the exported RegisterEventListener() function.  The first parameter 
// is the event type (from the EventType table) and the second parameter is the callback function that's called every
// time the event is triggered.  The callback function should take a table as its only parameter and return nothing:
//		function EventCallback(eventData)
// 
// RegisterEventListener() returns an id to your listener.  When you no longer wish to receive an event, call the 
// exported RemoveEventListener() function and pass it this id.  If you don't need to ever stop listening for the
// event, it's safe to discard the id and let C++ clean it up on program exit.  If your function goes out of scope,
// you will still incur the performance cost of receiving the event, though no other ill effects will occur.
// 
// Internally on the C++ side, a ScriptEventListener object is created and registered as a proxy for each script 
// listener.  When it receives the event, it calls your ScriptEvent::VBuildEventData() to build the m_eventData table.
// It then calls your registered script function, passing this table in as a parameter.  Note that if you don't need 
// the event to be able to be received by the script, you don't need to override VBuildEventData().
